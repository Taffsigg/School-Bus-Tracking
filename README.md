# School-Bus-Tracking
Tracking school buses and students has become a mainstream issue beacuse decision of whether it would be quicker to wait for the arrival of school bus or to hire a cab as the bus is late/missed to reach school. Therefore this project intend to aid in the bus arrival intimation by bringing in an application that will help in successfully tracking the school bus and the child onboard. Application can also be used to inform the parents whether their child has boarded the school bus as well as arrival at school. GPS based Android Phone will be used by parents to enter the bus number in which their child travels. Parents can also enter the source and the user will get detailed information about the location of the bus

# Application Description
This application uses RFID and GPS based Android Phone where the tracker is used for locating the current geographic position of the bus and RFID(Radio Frequency Identification Device) is used to uniquely identify every child.This system uses a database on backend to store the relevant information about the bus and the child which is used to update the application.
